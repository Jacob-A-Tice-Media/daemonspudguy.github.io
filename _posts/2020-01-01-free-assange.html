<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Julian Assange has been imprisoned in London for allegedly violating his bail terms. This was just after Ecuador decided to remove his asylum status. He was arrested under orders from US, because WikiLeaks has information about CIA Project Vault 7, a mass surveillance program. Assange is being charged for hosting content documenting the illegal actions being performed on unaware citizens. How about you arrest the heads of the CIA?</p>
