<p>So far, this year has been a mixed bag. My YouTube channel lost comments, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV4jttBVmGE">which you can learn about here</a>, my school year went unfinished, I only got to be at my Dad's place for a week (my dad hosts this site, in case you were wondering), and my legal guardians were in Italy for 2 weeks. On the plus side, my Twitter account was reinstated, I got an old computer from the school I go to, and I will be going to Ontario in August. I will talk about my thoughts on the year overall in January of 2020!</p>
